simple newtab page

 - Buttons
 - type to search

To use with firefox (developer edition only as it will be unsigned):
 1. Zip up this repo with no compression. To do this on macos run: `zip -r -Z  store start.zip *`
 2. drag the resulting file onto the addons window

If you want to use this with normal firefox you will have to get it signed by mozilla(or combine all source files into 1 html file and use an extension like: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/)
